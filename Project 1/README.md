### Project Motivation

The project above is an assignment project for Data Science Nanodegree on uDacity. The main idea of this project is to learn the foundations of data science and communicating with stakeholders. 

The three business questions asked here are: <br/>
1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston? By how much do prices spike?<br/>
2. Which Neighborhood is most expensive and what kind of listings are there in majority<br/>
3. Which params of listings impact the most on the price?<br/>

### File Descriptions
