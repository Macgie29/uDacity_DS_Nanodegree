### Project Motivation <a name="paragraph1"></a>

The project above is a capstone project for Data Science Nanodegree on uDacity. The main idea of this project is to learn the foundations of data science and communicating with stakeholders.

The main question asked here is to find the most important factor for completition of the offer, but also to answer three questions: <br/>
1. How looks distribution of genders among Starbucks App Users?<br/>
2. How does an income distribution looks like among Starbucks App Users?<br/>
3. How does age distribution looks like among Starbucks App Users?<br/>
